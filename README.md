# Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## Your Task

My task was to create a weather app that allows a user to look for weather from multiple cities.

I used https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 to get api key as well as the calls to get the weather data

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Struggles

This weeks assignment proved to be very difficult knowing where to get the code. After working with tutor, teammates BCS and TAs, getting code from assignments is acceptable.
Used W3 Schools for tempature conversions
